Hello! My name is Ruy Alonso, and I am a young pentester. In this blog, I will post writeups of retired `HTB` machines, `CTFs` that I will create, notes of pentesting and my travel until I get the `OSCP`.

## Objectives

These are my goals for my pentesting career:

- eCPPTv2 certification
- OSCP certification
- OSED certification
- OSEP certification

## Contents

In this blog I am going to be doing and explaining these contents:

- Writeups -> `HTB` (retired machines), `THM` (AD labs), `Port Swigger` and `VulnHub`
- SQLi (SQL injection)
- BOF (Buffer Overflow)
- CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
- SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
- AD (Active Directory)
- Linux & Windows Privilege escalation
- Offensive Python scripting

## Practices

To practice those contents, I am going to be practicing with `HTB` machines, challenges and fortresses. I will also be practicing `Web Hacking` with `Port Swigger` challenges and some `AD` labs, from `THM`. Last but not least, I will practice some machines from the platform `VulnHub`. 
In this blog, I will upload writeups of the machines and challenges from those platforms.

## Goodbye

I hope you enjoy my content, and I also hope you learn a lot. If you have any doubt, please send me a message via Discord.
This is enough for the presentation, I'll see you in next post!
